# phonevalid

A little single-purpose site that checks if a phone number follows the NANP.

"Follows the NANP" here means that it adheres to the standards set by the North American Numbering Plan Administration, the ogranization in charge of defining the standards that govern North American telephone numbers.

Should work with PHP >= 5.4.0.
